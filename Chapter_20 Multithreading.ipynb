    "A thread is a separate flow of execution. This means that your program will have two things happening at once. But for most Python 3 implementations the different threads do not actually execute at the same time: they merely appear to.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s tempting to think of threading as having two (or more) different processors running on your program, each one doing an independent task at the same time. That’s almost right. The threads may be running on different processors, but they will only be running one at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting multiple tasks running simultaneously requires a non-standard implementation of Python, writing some of your code in a different language, or using multiprocessing which comes with some extra overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the way CPython implementation of Python works, threading may not speed up all tasks. This is due to interactions with the GIL that essentially limit one Python thread to run at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks that spend much of their time waiting for external events are generally good candidates for threading. Problems that require heavy CPU computation and spend little time waiting for external events might not run faster at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is true for code written in Python and running on the standard CPython implementation. If your threads are written in C they have the ability to release the GIL and run concurrently. If you are running on a different Python implementation, check with the documentation too see how it handles threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running a standard Python implementation, writing in only Python, and have a CPU-bound problem, you should check out the multiprocessing module instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecting your program to use threading can also provide gains in design clarity. Most of the examples you’ll learn about in this tutorial are not necessarily going to run faster because they use threads. Using threading in them helps to make the design cleaner and easier to reason about.\n",

    "### Daemon Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, a `daemon` is a process that `runs in the background`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python threading has a more specific meaning for daemon. A daemon thread will shut down immediately when the program exits. One way to think about these definitions is to consider the daemon thread a thread that runs in the background without worrying about shutting it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a program is running Threads that are not daemons, then the program will wait for those threads to complete before it terminates. Threads that are daemons, however, are just killed wherever they are when the program is exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look a little more closely at the output of your program above. The last two lines are the interesting bit. When you run the program, you’ll notice that there is a pause (of about 2 seconds) after `__main__` has printed its all done message and before the thread is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pause is Python waiting for the non-daemonic thread to complete. When your Python program ends, part of the shutdown process is to clean up the threading routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the source for Python threading, you’ll see that threading._shutdown() walks through all of the running threads and calls .join() on every one that does not have the daemon flag set.\n",
    "\n",
    "So your program waits to exit because the thread itself is waiting in a sleep. As soon as it has completed and printed the message, .join() will return and the program can exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently, this behavior is what you want, but there are other options available to us. Let’s first repeat the program with a daemon thread. You do that by changing how you construct the Thread, adding the daemon=True flag:"
